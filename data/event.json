It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",

Important for us is what the devonfw can offer our customers in, possibly near, future, but also we would like to come to our customers’ expectations coming currently from real engagements. That is why topics like micro frontends, state management architectures, new web APIs (Progressive Web Apps), desktop applications (e.g. Electron) or mobile applications (e.g. Capacitor) are very welcome as well.",
